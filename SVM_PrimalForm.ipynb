    "#### Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. In this implementation, we will be using SVM for binary classification in the primal form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The primal form of SVM involves finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the two classes of data. The hyperplane is defined by a weight vector `w` and a bias term `b`. The goal is to find the values of `w` and `b` that maximize the margin between the two classes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To find the optimal values of `w` and `b`, we can use convex optimization. We can define an objective function that maximizes the margin subject to the constraint that all data points are correctly classified. This can be formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, which can be solved using a convex optimization solver such as CVXPY.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps taken in this implementation are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the necessary libraries: We import the CVXPY library for convex optimization, and the Pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Load the training and test datasets: We load the training and test datasets from CSV files using the Pandas library. We extract the input features and target labels from the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preprocess the data: We preprocess the data by replacing the target labels with -1 and 1, and normalizing the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define the SVM model: We define the SVM model using CVXPY. We define the weight vector `w` and bias term `b` as variables, and define the objective function and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Train the SVM model: We solve the optimization problem using CVXPY to find the optimal values of `w` and `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluate the SVM model: We evaluate the SVM model on the test dataset by computing the accuracy and confusion matrix."
